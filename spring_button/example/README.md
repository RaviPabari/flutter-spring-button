## Description
This is a very simple widget for having UI elements that respond to taps with a spring animation.  It is more an extension to the GestureDetector 
widget than an original new widget.

## How-to-Use
Simply create a SpringButton widget with your parameters. It is very similar to a GestureDetector widget so it should be familiar. That's it!

Please see the example project and the documentation for understanding the parameters.


## Notes
I started using and learning Flutter only some weeks ago so this package might have some parts that don't make sense, 
that should be completely different, that could be much better, etc. Please let me know! Nicely! 

Any help, suggestion or criticism is appreciated! 

Cheers.
